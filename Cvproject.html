                      27.4. What kinds of music do you like to listen to? Or What’s your 
                      favorite kind of music?
                      My music taste varies widely from West to East and from the 90s to modern 
                      EDM. But if Korean pop is considered as a kind of music, then yeah, that’s my 
                      favorite of all time. More than half of my playlists are Korean songs and I always 
                      keep myself updated with the news related to Korean showbiz.

                      to a musical performance?
                      Once in a blue moon I attend a concert, since the ticket price for foreign 
                      artists’ concerts is so out of my reach that I can only stay home and watch 
                      online. It was 2014 that I finally did go to a concert on my own, obviously it 
                      was an international music concert. It was absolutely mind-blowing and 
                      unforgettable for me.
